You have a Cisco mesh network. What protocol allows multiple APs to connect with many redundant connections between nodes?
A.	LWAPP
B.	AWPP
C.	STP
D.	IEEE
Answer: Option B

Explanation:

Each AP in a mesh network runs the Adaptive Wireless Path Protocol (AWPP). This protocol allows RAPs to communicate with each other to determine the best path back to the wired network via the RAP.

In Cisco's Unified Wireless Solution, what is the split-MAC architecture?
A.	The split-MAC architecture uses MAC addresses to create a forward/filter table and break up collision domains.
B.	The split-MAC architecture allows the splitting of 802.11 protocol packets between the AP and the controller to allow processing by both devices.
C.	The split-MAC architecture uses MAC addresses on the wireless network and IP addresses on the wired network.
D.	The split-MAC architecture uses MAC addresses to create a forward/filter table and break up broadcast domains.
Answer: Option B

Explanation:

The split-MAC architecture allows the splitting of 802.11 protocol packets between the Cisco LWAPP-based AP, which handles real-time portions of the protocol, and the WLAN controller, which handles those items that are not time sensitive.
